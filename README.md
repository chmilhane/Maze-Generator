## [Maze Generation: Recursive Backtracking](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking)

1. Choose a starting point in the field.
2. Randomly choose a wall at that point and carve a passage through to the adjacent cell, but only if the adjacent cell has not been visited yet. This becomes the new current cell.
3. If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that has uncarved walls and repeat.
4. The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the starting point.
